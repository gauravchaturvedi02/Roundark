<p><strong>Background:</strong><br/>
Established in 1985, Satya Paul today is an internationally acclaimed fashion brand. The brand got recognition for its unique design concepts and a vivid color palette. Satya Paul introduced the concept of choreographed collections in 1985 when there was very limited awareness about designer brands. With its exceptional work the brand has made a strong presence in more than 35 locations in India and at select high street boutiques abroad. Besides high-end stores, the brand also has an online presence for the avid online shoppers. 
</p>
<p>The brand popularized the style of concept-based designs but faced troubles with the sales from their online store. The team was looking to strengthen their online presence with increased traffic, better ranks and more leads. To achieve this goal Satya Paul hired Round Ark as their search engine optimization partner.

<p><strong>Challenge:</strong><br/>
As Satya Paul is a highly reputed brand, they had good traffic to the website, but this was not on relevant keywords. Further, the traffic visiting the online store was not getting converted. We brainstormed with the Satya Paul team to understand the problem areas, prepared an audit report and came out with many loopholes affecting their online business.  
</p>
<p><strong>
The Endeavor
</strong></p>
<p>
    
Once we know the problems, the next step was to work on them to remove them and help the business get improved results. Our focus areas while working on their SEO project were: the content quality, website architecture and the quality of links. We rehashed the content as per visitor expectations and redeveloped the website structure to make it more user-friendly. 
</p><p>
Competitor's analysis helped us get some high-quality links. We kept their strategies in the mind while forming an action plan for our client. Besides creating a quality link, our focus was also on removing the toxic links.

<p><strong>Creativity:</strong><br/>
Satya Paul is a fashion brand and can run only when it offers value as per customer behavior and their expectations. Our Reddit promotion techniques helped us understand buyer behavior and the latest market trend. Reddit promotion included close attention to visitor comments and conversations for market analysis. This helped us improve the content on the website and reshape it to match the visitor expectations.  
</p>
<p><strong>Getting Results:</strong><br/>


<p>We successfully delivered the project by achieving the promised results in the given timeframe. With  the improved content, new website structure and better links, Satya Paul saw amazing growth of around 1665 in their quarterly revenue. The average session duration shot from 2.39 in March 2015 to 4.30 in July 2015, which was around 80% more.
