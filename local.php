        <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-1">Prospective customer are searching your business locally.
    Connect with them through effective local search marketing</a>

         

        <div id="accordion-1" class="accordion-section-content">

         <p>With 1 in 3 of the Google searches being for local businesses,
 it has got imperative for every business to get their website onto
 the first page of Google in the local area. Local SEO is a lot different 
 from traditional SEO campaign. If you own a local business, you cannot
 rely only on traditional SEO campaigns to get on the top of local search results.</p> 

<p>In the highly competitive market, Local SEO is a strong weapon for the small
 businesses to stand out in the SERPs. But this needs a thorough understanding 
 of local ranking factors, different tools, strategies and other factors that
 can help you rise to the top of organic results.</p>

        <div id="accordion-2" class="accordion-section-content">

            <p>In broader terms, Local SEO is just a subset of the overall website
 optimization process for the improved rankings and search results.
 Focus of this marketing strategy is on the searches that include
 geographic modifiers such as “book shop in Delhi” or “the best restaurant near me.”</p>

<p>At large it might look similar to organic SEO, but it is very different from it. 
The focus of local SEO is on offering better results to the searchers as per their
 current location. For instance, if you search for ‘best Italian restaurant’
 on your mobile phone or the desktop, Google will give you the list of restaurants that are nearest to you.</p> 

<p>Top rankings in local searches include a combination of general
 SEO best practices and some selected strategies effective only for local results.</p>

    <div class="accordion-section">

        <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-3">How to get impressive results in local SEO?</a>

         

        <div id="accordion-3" class="accordion-section-content">

         <p>Getting the best results in Local SEO is not a one day task.
 It is a lengthy process that needs proper planning and apt execution of the strategies.
 Unlike link building in organic SEO, you don’t have to focus on this in local SEO.
 This is more about effective local NAP citation, local reviews, and My Business signals.</p> 

<p>This is a blend of various factors, which you need to address systematically.
 The whole objective behind all the activities for Local SEO is to help people feel
 comfortable on your website. To get top ranks and happy customers you should focus on:</p> 

<p><strong>Google Places:</strong> This is the very first step in the local business optimization process.
 Don’t forget to claim your business on Google Places for Business page.
 Further, ensure that the contact information, business address, and other
 important details are complete. Make it easier for Google to find you easily
 when people looking for businesses in a specific category by providing clear
 and precise category information.</p>

<p> • The important details in Google My Business include:</p> 

<p> • Long and unique description with correct links</p>

<p> • Pick the right category</p>

<p> • Upload high-quality photos</p>

<p> • Add business address and phone number</p>

<p> • Add opening time</p>

<p> • Ger customer reviews</p>

<p><strong>On-page local SEO:</strong> Address is the most important part of local business.
 You should maintain a consistency while mentioning business address at different locations.
 Be it listing or local page optimization on the website,
 you should use the address in a consistent format. 
 The title tag of the page should have a brand name, targeted keyword and the location.</p>

<p>You can also embed a map on your ‘contact us’ page to get better rankings in local SEO.</p> 

<p><strong>Local link building:</strong> Link building and citation are equally important for local
 SEO as these are for organic SEO. The tragedy is that this is one of the most overlooked 
 parts of the local SEO. Like standard SEO campaigns, local SEO also relies on
 high-quality links from other local and relevant businesses. The only different
 between the link building for organic SEO and local SEO is that the former 
 focuses on high authority websites while the later is about getting links
 from local websites that are talking about the similar business like yours.</p> 

<p><strong>Local reviews:</strong> Reviews have a strong impact on the decision-making process of the online
 buyers as well as on your rankings. So you should make honest efforts to acquire real reviews
 from the users. Local reviews are not just about Google reviews; these also include user
 reviews on local directories like Yelp.
 You can get in touch with your customers to request them for a review.</p>

        <div id="accordion-4" class="accordion-section-content">

         <p>Local SEO is a lengthy process that needs commitment,
 deep knowledge and ample time, which you might lack due to 
 other business responsibilities. Further, the online world
 is highly flexible with new updates from Google every now and then.
 Ignorance of these changes and updates can put your business at risk
 and affect your rankings. Some of the compelling reasons to
 take help of experts for effective local SEO are:</p>

<p> • They know the rules and regulations applicable in your area</p>

<p> • They understand the Google algorithm and ranking factors</p>

<p> • They have experience of working for your target audience</p>

<p> • They can provide quick response when your clients need you</p>
