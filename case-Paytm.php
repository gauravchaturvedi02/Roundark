<p><strong>Background:</strong><br/>Paytm started its journey as a prepaid mobile recharge website in 2010 and in a short span of time it has transformed into one of the largest e-commerce marketplaces. The website today has collaboration with the leading brands and offers great deals on online shopping, mobile bill payments, movie tickets and utility bill payments. In the beginning, the company got first mover advantage due to its unique concept but  soon started following competition from other entrants in the market.
</p>
<p>
The competition raised the need of investing in search engine optimization. The group knew that SEO is important to grab the market  share from the competitors, but did not know how to do it. This led them to come to Round Ark. The highly skilled and knowledgeable SEO team was assigned the responsibility to help the brand achieve their objective of improved ranking and boost in the traffic.

<p><strong>Research:</strong><br/>
The objective of investing in SEO was to increase traffic, get better rankings on selected keywords and mapping of keywords on each page. As research is essential for any campaign, we also started working on the project with keyword and website analysis. The team also spent time on understanding competitors, their strategies, and  the target market. 


<br/>The first step in the process was to divide the keywords into the three categories: 

<ul><li>
    Mobile
    </li>
    <li>DTH</li>
    <li>
        Bus Tickets
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>   
We also focused on the website quality and analyzed it for the speed, performance, and architecture to optimize it to achieve the goal.

<p><strong>Results & Traffic Boost:</strong><br/>The design and SEO team worked together to optimize the website for improved rankings and better performance.

<p>RoundArk was founded in 2006 as a result of a simple observation: people have transformed how they live, work, shop, and buy, but businesses have not adapted.

With our powerful, easy to use, integrated set of applications, businesses can attract, engage, and delight customers by delivering inbound experiences that are relevant, helpful, and personalized.
