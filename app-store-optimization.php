        <div id="accordion-1" class="accordion-section-content">

        <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-2">App Indexing</a>

         

        <div id="accordion-2" class="accordion-section-content">

            <p>A large number of users rely on mobile searching and look for 
content even in the app downloaded by them apart from websites.
 Therefore, Google has turned its focus on content app indexing
 which has resulted into better visibility in the search engines
 and app engagement. App Indexing allows Google to index the 
 application in the same as the websites are being indexed.
 You can observe the links of Android apps in the Google
 search result that leading to the appropriate content within the app.
 For instance, if you are carrying Google search on a particular subject
 on your mobile, Google will reflect the concerned app result for the relevant content.</p> 

<p>Until 2013, indexing was limited to desktop and mobile app,
 but the recent developments have resulted into app indexing as
 a part of search results. Google perform app indexing is done
 with the help of certain tools such as sitemap file or Google 
 webmaster tools. If the user has the app installed on his device,
 he could see the content enclosed within the app. Thus,
 it gives the users an opportunity to view the content
 within the app along with the mobile webpage.</p>

<p>If the content on the website and the app is similar,
 the app results show up as deep links in the search results.
 Tapping on these deep links on devices in which the app is
 installed will take the user directly to the main content.
 A lot of data is stored within the app that remains undiscovered.
 App indexing results into better user experience which is 
 developing into an effective tool for communication.
 App indexing allows refined searches with accurate data 
 leading to enhanced visibility of the apps in the search engines.</p>

 marketing campaigns in order to reduce the cost of paid

 network. Even if the app is not online, the addition of 
 newsletter and emails can still create a contact with the customers.</p>
