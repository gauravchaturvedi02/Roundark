<p>The store entered into the online world in 2003 with the exclusive collection sourced from the remotest corners of the country. Customer satisfaction and their delight is the center of every activity at Utsav Fashion and this is what brought them in contact with Round Ark. The brand had the social presence but was struggling to engage the visitors and increase the follower base. They understood the immense power of social media in increasing their business with more customers from the social media. But the problem was a right direction and effective strategies to engage the audience. 

</p>
<p>The social media team at Round Ark was tasked to create a customized strategy to grow Utsav Fashion's online following on different social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter with increased interactions with the existing and potential customers.

        GETTING RESULT:
        </strong></p>
<p><strong>Facebook Competition:</strong><br/>
The main focus, in the beginning, was to increase the engagement and get more followers. To increase the number of followers, comments likes and re-tweets we ran different competitions. The campaigns were a huge success with an increase of 20, 454 fans in a short span of just three months. 
	
</p>
<p>	
The success of the competitions encouraged us to move onto our other social media marketing strategies for all the three channels: Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus. That included sharing informative posts and different contests like MixNMatch, Hunt for Earrings, The Saree Twist, and Bollywood Focus Post. The main objective behind all these contests was to grow website traffic, which we achieved successfully. 
</p><p>
Our efforts paid them in a long run with a continuous increase in the number of followers and fans on different social media channels.
