<p>The real challenge Aavaranaa faced was to get more leads from their online store. They had invested in SEO but were not satisfied with the results. And with a hope to get better results from the online promotion of their business they approached Round Ark. Aavaranaa wanted a company on which they can rely for overall solutions; not just the improved rankings or traffic.

<p><strong> Challenge:</strong><br/>
The major challenge while working for Aavaranaa was stiff competition and the content on their website. We had to redevelop the whole website and had to work on their content from the scratch. Further, they also wanted increased leads, so we had to look for some different strategies to achieve all the objectives.	
</p>
<p><strong>
   Best Practices:
    </strong><br/>
To help Aavaranaa achieve its business goals, our team designed bespoke SEO strategies after an audit to identify keywords. Besides the basic steps that include keyword optimization, website redevelopment, and content re-hash, we also adopted some unique approach. 

</p>
<p>
The major activities included buyer behavior analysis to understand where the website is lacking and toxic link removal. These links were also hampering the traffic and SEO rankings of the website. 

</p>
<p>
    The best practice for result oriented SEO of Aavaranaa was Reddit promotion activity. It was a detailed promotion plan with thorough analysis. The SEO experts first understood the trend in the fashion industry by keeping a record of the ongoing conversation threads at Reddit. Based on the comments and user queries, we rephrased the whole content for the website and products.
