Since its inception, the media house has grown by leaps and bounds and made a strong position in the country.

This is where the media house felt need to expert search engine optimization support.
</p>
<p>
The online market already has the presence of so many leading newspapers and publishing houses. The online audience has numerous choices when they search for any news. Sandesh faced tough competition and wanted some strategies to boost their SEO traffic, increase engagement and better crawl rate. They approached us for an effective solution for better rankings and improved performance. Engagement is the key for any newspaper and this is possible only with high-quality content. We understood the challenges the media house was facing and started working upon them to help Sandesh achieve the objective.

<p><strong>Research:</strong><br/>
Working on any project is impossible until we have in-depth knowledge about it. And gaining this knowledge is possible only with a thorough research. The major challenge while working on SEO for Sandesh was to find the bad links and fix them. 

<br/>The SEO experts analyzed the non-crawled pages to fix problems like 404, redirection and image optimization. They also performed competitor analysis to gain some knowledge and use helpful strategies. 

</p>
<p><strong>Our SEO Approach:
</strong></p>
<p>We worked on every aspect to ensure lasting results. The strategies include backlink analysis to segregate the bad links and remove them. Content is the backbone for a media house and keeping this thing in the mind we tweaked their website content as per the visitor behavior. This helped us control the bounce rate and increase the average time spent on the website. 

</p>
<p>   
The next action plan in the strategies was to create brand awareness. The regular readers were aware of the print edition, but very few knew about the online presence of Sandesh. So we planned to grow brand awareness with social media channels. We also worked with the development team to restructure the website for increased crawling rate.
