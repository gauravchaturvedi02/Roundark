<p><strong>
Best practice:
</strong></p>
<p>After having a look at the analysis data, the team noticed that the website needs a lot of improvements in terms of content quality and the user experience as it was not set as per the best practices. We step by step worked on all the aspects that included site architecture development, content re-hash and toxic link removal. Besides this, we also built some links on the basis of competitor analysis and opted for sky scrapper techniques for content marketing. The sky scrapper techniques helped Ferns N Petals get increased visitors with the quality backlinks.
