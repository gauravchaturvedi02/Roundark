        <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-1">What Is an e-Marketplace?</a>

         

        <div id="accordion-1" class="accordion-section-content">

           <p>An online marketplace is an ecommerce website that
 connects the buyers and the sellers through the internet.
 This is a blessing for the small businesses with limited budget.
 By registering the business on these e-commerce websites,
 one does not need to invest in personal websites and marketing
 campaigns. Amazon, Alibaba, Etsy, eBay, OpenTable, and
 AirBnB are some of the leading marketplaces in varied
 industries having a global presence.</p> 

<p>The e-marketplaces allow companies to list their products,
 obtain new buyers, develop a streamlined trading network 
 and make transactions. The sellers have to focus on sourcing,
 inventory listing, order management and customer support.
 While the technology, infrastructure, payment processing
 and risk management are the responsibilities of the 
 marketplace platform, getting leads and generating
 sales is the responsibility of the seller.</p>

    <div class="accordion-section">

        <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-2">How does it work?</a>

         

        <div id="accordion-2" class="accordion-section-content">

            <p>The marketplace owners provide sellers a platform to
 list their products and generate sales. They charge
 some commission as a percentage on every sale,
 which is the source of income for the marketplace.</p> 

<p>Actually, this is a win-win situation for all the concerned parties.</p> 

<p><strong>Marketplace owner –</strong> they don’t have to bother about the inventory management and shipping.</p>

<p><strong>Vendors –</strong> they don’t need a huge capital to start 
a business from the scratch. They just have to list their products.
 Further, they get an opportunity to just focus on the
 product development and quality management.</p> 

<p><strong>Customers –</strong> they get a lot of options for the same products and grab the best deal </p>

        </div><!--end .accordion-section-content-->

    </div>

    

    <div class="accordion-section">

        <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-3">What is the importance of marketing of marketplace?</a>

         

        <div id="accordion-3" class="accordion-section-content">

         <p>A marketplace without buyers is nothing.
 As an entrepreneur with a limited budget, 
 you can register and update your business
 at the marketplace, but you cannot 
 generate profit without buyers.</p> 

<p>So from where do you get the buyers? In the highly
 competitive online market, you cannot expect buyers 
 to type the name of your business and find the source
 to buy it until you are a really popular and reputed brand.
 The online market is highly competitive and
 buyers get hundreds of options when looking for a specific product.</p> 

<p>Moreover, customers search for the products and services
 on sites and in-app. So you need to boost your advertising
 process to reach where your customers are. This is possible
 only with effective, resulted oriented and targeted
 advertising campaigns.</p>

        <div id="accordion-4" class="accordion-section-content">

        <p>To get found by the buyers in top search results,
 you need to invest in digital marketing. The tricky
 world of the online market might make it difficult
 for you to focus on different dimensions. 
 It is better that you lay all the emphasis
 on your products, services, and other
 business verticals and let the authorized
 partners take responsibility for your brand’s promotion.</p>

<p>The marketplace promotion experts know the right techniques,
 requirements and strategies for promotion of varied products.</p>
