<p><strong>Research and Strategy formulation:</strong><br/>
The SEO process for the brand started with their website analysis, content analysis, and competitor analysis. It helped us find out the problem areas that included bad links, low-quality content and some website issues. The initial analysis process gave us a direction to start working on their project for not just the increased rankings and traffic but also for better user experience on their website  
</p>
<p>
Utilizing the insight, we redeveloped their website to make it more user-friendly and SEO friendly. The next process was to remove toxic links and build high-quality links on the basis of competitor analysis. The content team also worked on quality of the content. And Reddit promotion techniques helped them understand customer behavior and their expectations from a cosmetic brand. As H2O Plus has huge audience base from all across the world, the major challenge we faced was to offer value to every visitor and write content that suits every  customer; irrespective of their location.
