        <div id="accordion-2" class="accordion-section-content">

           <p>Today, the dominant commercial search engines Google,
 Bing, and Yahoo maintain the major web traffic.
 Search engines are the basic method of navigation
 for maximum internet users, even though the market

        <p>The impressive SEO campaign involves a process of six steps to gain the maximum results. The basic steps include</p>

<p> • <strong> Keyword Research:</strong> Keyword optimization is the fundamental step of the SEO process.
 The keyword searched should be an amalgamation of high usage by the researchers
 and that get low competition in the search engines. A considerable
 time is devoted to finding out the most relevant keywords to
 set the campaign in the correct direction.</p>

<p> • <strong> Competitive Research:</strong> After a thorough keyword research,
 the next step is to analyze the position of the target site in the search
 engines. For this, we make use of SEO matrices, indexing content,
 inbound links and domain age and many others. The research
 enables you to specify the position of your client’s website
 with its potent competitors and also identifying areas
 needing work on a priority basis.</p> 

<p> • <strong> Content Building:</strong> Content should be the priority
 for search engine optimization. For enhancing the position in the
 search results, that content quality should be high and related
 to the respective business domain. If the site has the most
 relevant content, it will compel the user to stay and to 
 revert for the content.</p> 

<p> • <strong> Page Optimization:</strong> Once the keyword research and content
 building is over, the next priority is given to on page optimization.
 This includes page titles, text-based navigation, site mapping,
 Meta descriptions and cleaning up the code.</p>

<p> • <strong> Follow Up:</strong> The reporting conducted at
 the beginning of the SEO campaign should be done at regular
 intervals including post optimization, ranking, website
 traffic levels and other relevant matrices to give 
 commendable results in SEO campaigns.</p>

 the measures that affect the listing of your website

 titles, Meta tags, and descriptions that influences

 an effective On-Page search engine optimization are mentioned below:</p>

<p><strong>Page Title Optimization:</strong> Being an essential SEO factor,
 each page of your website should have its unique title including 
 the relevant keywords. The title tag includes the business name,
 keywords, as it is the primary thing that is reflected by the search engines.</p> 

<p><strong>Meta Description Optimization:</strong> Meta descriptions accord the relevant
 space to incorporate keywords for your content, as these descriptions
 are used in the search results when your page is listed.</p> 

<p><strong>URL Structure:</strong> Improved crawling is achieved by
 including search engine friendly URLs. URLs crisp in 
 length and targeted keywords perform better in the search results.</p> 

<p><strong>Keyword Density:</strong> Keep the keyword density around 3-5%,
 as your usage of a keyword may result in your site brings banned
 from the search engines. Appropriate application of keyword is important.</p>

<p><strong>HTML Tags:</strong> Dividing the content into smaller and 
relevant sections make it accessible for the users to read and analyze.
 The sections can be divided into heading like H1, H2, H3 etc tags.
 Keyword rich headlines are more competent than the usual headlines.</p>  

<p><strong>Internal Linking:</strong> Internals can be used as the best 
tools in search engine optimization and upgrade the site’s 
visibility. Internal linking can be done by two potent 
methods such as content linking and permanent navigation links.</p>
