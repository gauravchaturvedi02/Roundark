        <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-1">What Is Digital Marketing?</a>

         

        <div id="accordion-1" class="accordion-section-content">

            <p>For an amateur, digital marketing encompasses all the forms of electronic media being utilized for the promotion of your products and brand name. Digital marketing varies from traditional marketing as the former includes the use of digital channels and strategies, empowering the organization to evaluate the on-going marketing campaigns. Focusing on the real time, the organizations can analyze what strategies are working for them and what isn't. </p>



<p>In the pursuit of digital marketing, various promotional techniques and methods are employed to reach out a larger audience and customer base via the featuring digital technologies. Utilizing the internet as the core promotional medium, digital marketing epitomizes the selection of services, products and marketing techniques. The various techniques involve search engine optimization, search engine marketing and link building. </p>



<p>The aspiration of digital marketing is to enhance customer engagement and furnishing mediums via which the customers can effectively interact with the brand name. These mediums incorporate branding services and delivery of digital media. Telephone calls, ad space, and billboards are completely erased from the market. Even magazines and newspapers are on the verge of dying out. The consumers prefer mediums which are convenient and accord them with instant outcomes. Therefore, their interest is shifted from conventional marketing forms to the state-of-art technologies. The consumers rely more on online measures and search engines for their daily requirements and seeking information on various aspects.</p>



<p>Digital marketing elaborates all about the strategies to reach out the appropriate audience employing the use of smart digitized channels and mediums. </p>

        <div id="accordion-2" class="accordion-section-content">

            <p><p>Before, we ponder over the question which is better digital marketing or physical marketing? Let us have a glance at what exactly term marketing implies? Marketing incorporates methods to understand the prospect's need and based on that design products and services that will cater to the target audience. It also includes promotional activities, market research, and advertisement. </p>



<p>Previously, physical marketing was largely used to reach the customer base, but with the advent and evolution of information technology, the market is realizing the value of digitization and its related techniques. As mentioned above, digital marketing involves usage of social networks and search engines for the brand awareness. However, the traditional marketing means examining the products physically so as to get the real time experience.</p> 



<p>There is no question to raise that digitization has completely taken over the traditional marketing methods owing to the following reasons:</p>



<ul>



<li>Digital marketing methods assist the business to develop a larger customer base, as it does not imply any interaction or physical appearance. </li>



<li>It gives the customer an opportunity to collaborate directly with the business. </li>



<li>It is not restricted to a particular place and conventional means, as a customer can interact at any place and time.</li>

        <div id="accordion-3" class="accordion-section-content">

         <p>We have already gained an insight about what digital marketing is all about and how it has completely covered traditional marketing from the market. The second question that we need to ponder on why digital marketing is required from the business perspective? Throwing light on some of the major highlights:</p>



<ul>



<li>Digital marketing enables to manage customer relationships across all the mentioned channels. It is the primary thing for a brand to understand their customers, in order to communicate with them effectively. This is the need of the hour. Deeper the brand can probe into the customer behavior and choices, the more customer engagement they develop.</li>



 



<li>Another advantage is that digitization develops quantifiable results which imply a measurable reaction of the traffic on the website.</li>







<li>Rather than calculating how many customers or prospective customers are online, it is better to turn the table around and ask who is not online these days. Nowadays people find digital technology as an integral part of their day to day existence.</li>







<li>A well framed social media campaign can deliver the same message to a large customer base than by spending less and consuming no time. Social media and search engines can access from any corner of the world.</li> 







<li>Digital marketing tactics make result tracking an easy process. Employing a huge range of analytics and data, the brands can evaluate their marketing campaigns.</li>



 <li>They can analyze the campaign performance, measuring the accomplishment in real time, according to you with an opportunity to plan effectively and instantly make the alterations.</li>
