 including search engine friendly URLs. URLs crisp in 
 length and targeted keywords perform better in the search results.</p>

relevant sections make it accessible for the users to read and analyze.

tools in search engine optimization and upgrade the site’s 
visibility. Internal linking can be done by two potent 
methods such as content linking and permanent navigation links.</p>
